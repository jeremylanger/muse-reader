# Dune Reader

## Experience Dune with an adjustable, natural reading speed.

I found it easy to lose track of my place while reading, reading the same line over and over.

Part of this is mental (am I getting distracted?), another part is based on text sizing and density.

I've solved for this in a couple of ways:

1. **Only show one paragraph at a time** - This makes each section easier to digest, like an IG reel vs a full YouTube video.
2. **Fade in each word, one at a time** - The animation effect makes it easy to stay engaged and your eyes will naturally track with the movement. The timing between each word animation is dynamically based on the length of the word and punctuation, so the reading speed feels natural.

## A few other cool features

Ever wonder what a word means and have to Google it? Not anymore, just **click the word** and a definition will appear. I used this countless times during my reading of Dune and it was a lifesaver.

Is the default reading speed too slow? You can easily crank that bad boy up.

Have you already started reading the book but want to start this digital version? **Click the search button** and start typing the sentence you're reading! You'll jump right to where you left off.

Hopefully you find this Dune Reader as enjoyable as I have. I started reading the physical book and switched over to this version I made and I couldn't get enough! It's mobile optimized as well (I recommend landscape!).
